        <h1>Project Improvements</h1>

        <p>I designed a usability test to identify bugs or missing features that affect the user experience of my game. I selected this approach for two reasons: one, it allows me to adjust the scope based on the amount of time I have this week; and two, a game’s quality is strongly tied to user experience.</p>

        <p>To gather expert feedback, I leveraged my role as Co-President of the Game Development & Arts Club (GDAC) to organize a Playtesting Night during Week 10. I didn’t just do this for the class: I think it is a great opportunity for students in any game or game-adjacent class to get feedback on their work before final submissions. But I digress.</p>

        <p>Before I attend the event, it is crucial that I fix all major playability issues outlined in my design brief. This ensures that the feedback I receive during playtesting is useful and non-redundant, i.e. they highlight new and thoughtful challenges rather than reiterating problems that I am already aware of and am actively working to fix.</p>

        <p>I plan to conduct playtesting with at least three participants during the event. I aim to adhere to standard blind playtesting protocol:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Allow participants to playtest the game without any help or interruption.</li>
            <li>Record the time it takes for each participant to finish (or DNF, if applicable).</li>
            <li>After they finish, ask the following questions:
                <ol>
                    <li>What are your overall thoughts on the experience? Did you enjoy the mystery?</li>
                    <li>How would you grade the difficulty of the game? Do you think it can be completed within an appropriate timeframe?</li>
                    <li>Were there any UI elements that you found prohibitive?</li>
                    <li>Are there any additional features you’d like to see in a game like this?</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The number of questions is intentionally limited to respect participants’ time (also because I anticipate the quality of responses will degrade past a certain number). I focus more on general and actionable items that have a direct impact on play.</p>

        <p>I designed a simple usability testing form to collect feedback ahead of time.</p>
