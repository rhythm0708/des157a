        <h1>Design Brief</h1>
        <p>My final project aims to improve the quality-of-life and UI/UX of my Every Picture studio project. There are animations, issues with contrast, and zoom-in features that I could implement to noticeably upgrade the play experience.</p>

        <p>For this project, I want to address some of the imperfections that my peers and I noticed. It is a functional product overall, but there are simple fixes that would make it a lot better. For example, it would be super helpful to have a zoom-in feature that allows you to read the text on images. I have considered a more ambitious project, but given the timeframe of the final, I think this is acceptable. A list of proposed changes is below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>(Must) Make short opacity transitions for when overlays appear/disappear</li>
            <li>(Must) Implement ‘Esc’ to exit overlays</li>
            <li>(Must) Increase contrast between green backgrounds and black text</li>
            <li>(Optional) Create iconography to represent characters</li>
            <li>(Optional) Instead of a dropdown menu, design an array of icons through which suspects are chosen</li>
            <li>(Optional) Add detective music that can be turned on or off</li>
            <li>(Optional) Sparkle or animation effect when “Next Case” button appears</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I will conduct usability tests to ensure that my final project is intuitive and playable. Specifically, I plan to conduct blind playtests with members of the Game Development & Arts Club (GDAC). Blind playtests will give me chances to observe how players navigate my interface and learn where they get stuck in my game. Their feedback will inform how I continue to iterate and build on my project. I will refrain from designing a second level; rather I will polish my existing level in a way that makes the game structure evident.</p>
