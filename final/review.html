        <h1>Expert Project Review</h1>

        <p class="bold">Context</p>
        <p>I conducted usability tests with 4 participants from my target demographic. The sampling method was purposive opportunistic sampling. I attended a Playtesting Night held by the Game Development & Arts Club (GDAC) on December 3rd, 2024, and conducted blind playtests there.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Participant 1: Cyman Deaver
                <ul>
                    <li>Male</li>
                    <li>Regularly plays games</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Participant 2: Simon Yoo & Marisol Costales-Juarez
                <ul>
                    <li>Male, Female</li>
                    <li>Casually play games; love mystery games</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Participant 3: Jasper Fadden O' Roarke
                <ul>
                    <li>Male</li>
                    <li>Game developer; loves RPGs</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bold">Task</p>
        <p>Participants were asked to solve the first case of my murder mystery game. They were not given additional instruction or assistance.</p>

        <p class="bold">Key Findings</p>
        <p>Below are the five most important observations from my playtest:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The game was more challenging than expected: it took playtesters 15 minutes on average, which I permitted.</li>
            <li>Clicking out of the zoomed-in image also gets rid of the first overlay. Having an 'X' button would be a convenient way for players to return to that state.</li>
            <li>Most playtesters benefitted from small hints, after which they were able to solve the puzzle. Consider a hint system.</li>
            <li>Some of the written text is hard to read even zoomed-in. Consider creating an 'eye' icon that shows a typed transcription.</li>
            <li>Some clues could be made clearer. Participants found it hard to connect a chemical flask symbol to the lab. Jorge's reason for leaving the door open should be hinted.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="bold">Changes</p>
        <p>I will address finding #2 and #5 for my final submission. The other three are more substantial changes better suited for an ambitious revision.</p>
