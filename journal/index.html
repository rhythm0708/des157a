                    <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
                    <time datetime="2024-10-29">29th October 2024</time>

                    <p>This is a scene that I set up and photographed for my “Every Picture” project. I intend for it to be interesting based on the sheer number of objects that are in the scene that are unordinary or out-of-place. If visitors to my site hover over certain objects, they will be prompted to click and view a zoomed-in photo of the object with observations described in text. This picture will facilitate the mystery that players will have to solve on my website.</p>

                    <p>I chose this topic because it’s a cool idea that I’d like to try and do. I love game design, and creating short, interactive experiences that leave an impression. This image enables me to do this in a way that is shareable and replayable. Upon re-examination of the photo, I wish I had adjusted the angle for a more direct shot. I also wish I had thought to take a panoramic shot and increased image quality. All in all, this image (and project) communicates my ambition to create engaging, gamic experiences through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                    <figure class="image-section">

                    </figure>

                    <p>This looks to be an environmental piece, taken during dusk. It depicts a natural scene along a body of water. The most interesting aspect of this image is its color: you don’t typically see these cool blue shades in the sky or in nature. I wonder how the photograph would look with different filters on. There is also interest if we think about where the photographer is standing: are they standing above the body of water? Or does the river end abruptly? Did they use a drone? The angle of the shot is cool as it highlights the curve of the river as it arrives toward the vanishing point. An obvious aspect of the photo is the concept; a mysterious aspect is the colors that emerge at the edges of the photo and the glow toward the center.</p>

                    <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
                    <time datetime="2024-10-17">23rd October 2024</time>

                    <p><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">This article</a> on visual thinking strategies, although targeted at educators, presents a cool array of photographs that compel close reading and critical thinking. They provide a good starting point into my next studio project about using pictures to tell an interactive narrative.</p>

                    <p>The article made me think about how context plays into our understanding of an image. Although at first glance we might understand the “what” of an image, it takes further reading to perceive interrelations between those elements. My task, as an image compositor and visual storyteller, is to provoke curiosity for this type of reading through the design of my website. One common attribute between images in the article is that they all had “something off” about them: something that goes against what we normally expect to see in the contexts depicted. For example, people lying on train tracks as a train whizzes by behind them.</p>

                    <p>An example of a website that uses image interaction in a novel way is <a href="http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/">Robby Leonardi’s Interactive Resumé</a>. The website uses scroll effects and movement animations to present his skills, experience, and qualifications. His design inspires visitors to read and absorb what would otherwise be dry information. I’m not planning to be that ambitious for this next studio project, but I’d love to explore information presentation in a gamified setting.</p>

                    <h2>Overlay Design Pattern</h2>
                    <time datetime="2024-10-17">17th October 2024</time>

                    <p>This week, I read the article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a> by Kathryn Whitenton. I thought that this was a well-written article. She did a great job articulating use cases for overlays and when you should consider alternatives. She even described ways to make overlays more palatable for users. Her examples helped me understand that there are many scenarios when overlays should not be used, and many things to consider when they are.</p>

                    <p>The author mentioned things I hadn’t even considered about the design of overlays. For example, she mentioned how users might hit the browser’s “back” button to escape an overlay, but doing so brings them to the previous page in their browsing history (overlays are not considered separate pages). This would introduce pain and frustration into the user experience. The solution she proposed was to reprogram the browser’s “back” button to close the overlay when it is open. I thought that this was a nifty tip, and something I could do with my current JavaScript experience (“event.preventDefault()”?). Tips like this helped me realize that there is so much work that goes into a good overlay—not just in terms of code, but in user testing and quality assurance as well.</p>

                    <h2>Researching Form Design</h2>
                    <time datetime="2024-10-13">13th October 2024</time>

                    <p>This week, I read an article called <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a> by Salim Ansari. I thought that the article was concise and insightful. It clarified the basic principles of form design for me and why they work. There were a lot of things in the article, for example “ask easy questions first,” which seemed pretty intuitive but it was nice to have it laid out and explained regardless. The images that the author chose were also effective. For example, the one chosen for the “provide matching keyboard” tip helped to clarify what the author meant. Overall, the article helped me realize just how much work goes into form design, from layout to design to code-automated features. I look forward to putting these ideas into practice and learning how to create the features discussed in the article.</p>

                    <p>I don’t encounter form designs too often, but one that I thought was nice is the Stardew Valley character customization form. There is a portrait on the top-left which provides visual reference for the information players are putting in. Everything is on one screen. The labels of required input fields are tinted red when the corresponding input field is blank. Default values are provided for non-essential fields. I like this form because it puts the user input into context in a concise and readable way; it allows interested players to spend time polishing the details, and others to complete it with minimal hassle.</p>
