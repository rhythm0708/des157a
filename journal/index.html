                    <h2>Overlay Design Pattern</h2>
                    <time datetime="2024-10-17">17th October 2024</time>

                    <p>This week, I read the article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a> by Kathryn Whitenton. I thought that this was a well-written article. She did a great job articulating use cases for overlays and when you should consider alternatives. She even described ways to make overlays more palatable for users. Her examples helped me understand that there are many scenarios when overlays should not be used, and many things to consider when they are.</p>

                    <p>The author mentioned things I hadn’t even considered about the design of overlays. For example, she mentioned how users might hit the browser’s “back” button to escape an overlay, but doing so brings them to the previous page in their browsing history (overlays are not considered separate pages). This would introduce pain and frustration into the user experience. The solution she proposed was to reprogram the browser’s “back” button to close the overlay when it is open. I thought that this was a nifty tip, and something I could do with my current JavaScript experience (“event.preventDefault()”?). Tips like this helped me realize that there is so much work that goes into a good overlay—not just in terms of code, but in user testing and quality assurance as well.</p>

                    <h2>Researching Form Design</h2>
                    <time datetime="2024-10-13">13th October 2024</time>

                    <p>This week, I read an article called <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a> by Salim Ansari. I thought that the article was concise and insightful. It clarified the basic principles of form design for me and why they work. There were a lot of things in the article, for example “ask easy questions first,” which seemed pretty intuitive but it was nice to have it laid out and explained regardless. The images that the author chose were also effective. For example, the one chosen for the “provide matching keyboard” tip helped to clarify what the author meant. Overall, the article helped me realize just how much work goes into form design, from layout to design to code-automated features. I look forward to putting these ideas into practice and learning how to create the features discussed in the article.</p>

                    <p>I don’t encounter form designs too often, but one that I thought was nice is the Stardew Valley character customization form. There is a portrait on the top-left which provides visual reference for the information players are putting in. Everything is on one screen. The labels of required input fields are tinted red when the corresponding input field is blank. Default values are provided for non-essential fields. I like this form because it puts the user input into context in a concise and readable way; it allows interested players to spend time polishing the details, and others to complete it with minimal hassle.</p>
